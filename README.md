<h1>Kuromi clockwatch // WIP</h1> 
##
<h4><i>Disclaimer</i></h4>
<p> I do not own all elements in this code. <br></p>
<p> A apologize for any english mistake, if you find one, feel free to contact me, so I can re-write.<br>
Made this project for my girlfriend, that loves the character Kuromi.

<h3><b>My step by step</b></h3>
<p>For <i>HTML</i> I've made a simple sketch to provide my page layout, divided by class for each clock element, like hours, minutes and seconds.
A main container centralized and filled with another 3 ones. <br>
